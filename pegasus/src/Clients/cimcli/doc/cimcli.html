<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<B>cimcli [operation]  [OperationTarget]  [options]  [valueParameters]</B>

<P>
cimcli is available for all platforms that support the Pegasus CIM Server.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P>
<B>cimcli</B>

is a command line test tool for executing CIM client operations.  It 
implements all of the DMTF CIM operations except for the modify and create 
class/instance operations and includes several other operations that are 
useful in testing CIM Servers including getting all namespaces and 
enumerating all instances in a namespace.  
<P>
Each execution of cimcli invokes one or more CIM Operations with the command
parameters equivalent to the CIM Operations defined in the CIM Operations over
HTTP specification.
<P>
In addition to the basic CIM Operations defined in the DMTF specification 
(DMTF DSP 0200), cimcli implements a number of other  
operations that support testing and querying CIM servers (ex.  an 
operation to query for namespaces and another to get all instances in a 
namespace) which require multiple CIM Operations.  The additional 
operations include: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1.</B>

<DD>
Enumerate namespaces (ns) - Returns a list of the namespaces available
from the CIMOM.
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
Enumerate all instance names (niall) - Returns a list of all instance
names in the defined namespace.  
<DT><B>3.</B>

<DD>
Turn CIM Server statistics on and off (DEPRECATED) - Turns the statistics flag
in the Server CIMObjectManager Class on or off for the OpenPegasus server.
This enables and disables execution of statistics gathering in the server.
This command is retained for compatibility but is DEPRECATED and will be
removed when a real alternative is included in the Pegasus release.
<P>
NOTE: This operation may be CIMServer type specific since not all CIMServers
implement the statistics functions.
<DT><B>4.</B>

<DD>
Test commands (ti) - A cimcli operation that executes tests of the 
characteristics of an instance requeste from the CIM Server.  This 
operation extend the capabilities of cimcli to actually compare 
information from the server with information in the command line input.  
<P>
The format of the cimcli command is generally:
<DT><B>cimcli [Operation] [OperationTarget] [options] [ValueParameters]</B>

<DD>
<P>
Note that options may be interspersed with the [OperationTarget] parameter but
that a) the ordering of [Operation] [OperationTarget] is fixed and any  [value
parameters] MUST occur after the [OperationTarget] parameter.
<P>
<DT><B>[Operation] </B>

<DD>
Defines the  operation to be executed. cimcli executes all of the DMTF
CIM Operations (ex. getclass) and a set of compound operation
(enumeratenamespaces). There are two forms for each [Operation]
definition, a short form typically two characters (i.e. gc) and the
long form which is the full name of the operation (i.e. getclass). The complete
set of operations can be viewed by calling cimcli with the option -hc.
<DT><B>[OperationTarget]</B>

<DD>
The [OperationTarget] is the name of the object for which the the operation is
requested.  
This parameter is operation dependent.  For example, with the getClass 
operation the [OperationTarget] is a CIM class name.  With the getInstance operation 
the object is a CIM instance name.  Note that some of the commands do not 
require an [OperationTarget] parameter.  Thus, for example, the [OperationTarget] 
is optional with the enumerateClasses operation as it is with the 
equivalent enumerateClassNames CIM operation.  Normally this is either a 
CIM class name or an instance name (classname plus keybindings).  In some 
operations one or the other is required.  In other operations, the 
behavior of the operation is dependent on whether class name or instance 
name is supplied.  
<P>
The format for instance name is defined as the model path in the CIM 
Specification and has the form:
<PRE>
    &lt;classname&gt;.&lt;keyPropertyName1&gt;=
        &lt;value1&gt;[,&lt;keypropertyNamex&gt;=&lt;valuex&gt;]*

    &lt;valuex&gt; is either a numeric value or a string value
    (enveloped in quotes). The quote marks surrounding
    string values are required.
</PRE>

However, to make inputting command line object names, cimcli offers a second
option for inputting the object name as [OperationTarget].  In this second
case, the [OperationTarget] Object is simply the class name and value
parameters are used to define the keypropertyName/value pairs.  In this case,
the quotation marks around string property values are optional and are required
only in the case where quotation marks would be required to define a value 
such as a string that includes quotation marks.
<P>
Thus, as an example, the input for a getInstance might be:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cimcli&nbsp;gi&nbsp;TennisPlayer.first=&quot;Patrick&quot;,last=&quot;Rafter&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cimcli&nbsp;gi&nbsp;TennisPlayer&nbsp;first=Patrick&nbsp;last=Rafter
<P>
In the second case, cimcli gets the class from the CIM Server and uses the
parameters to form a correct CIMObjectPath. In the first case, generally cimcli
uses the input path directly without getting the class from the server.
<P>
<DT><B>[options...] </B>

<DD>
Options are identified on the command line with the - or -- notation.
There are several types of options:
<P>
<DT><B>1.</B>

<DD>
Execution Modification Options - A set of options that are universal and 
modify or define the execution of the command or the form of the return.  
This includes options like setting the output format for object responses 
or requesting only summary operation.  
<P>
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
Connection Options - Options that define the connection for the operation.  
This includes options for defining the CIMServer address, namespace, and 
security options such as user name, password and SSL settings.  
<DT><B>3.</B>

<DD>
Operation Parameter Options - A set of options that represent the optional 
input parameters for selected operations.  The [operation] defines the CIM 
Operation that will be executed and the options define the optional 
request parameters.  Typical context options might be -n namespace (used 
on most but not all operations)or -niq which sets includequalifiers to 
false for operations that use the includeQualifiers optional parameter.  
<DT><B>4</B>

<DD>
Help Options - A set of options to display help (-h, --help, --ho to get a 
list of all options, and -hc to get a list of all commands).  When these 
options are requested, no operation is executed.  
<DT><B>[value-parameters]</B>

<DD>
Some of the operations allow or require extra parameters. these are
typically keywords or keyword/value pairs and are defined as part of
the particular operation that use them.
<P>
Any extra parameter entities on the command line that occur after the 
[Operation] and [Operation Target] and are not proceeded by &quot;-&quot; to 
indicate an option are considered value parameters.  These are used in some 
of the operations to provide additional information required or optionally 
desired by the operation.  See each operation definition to determine if 
extra parameters are required or allowed.  These may be either 
keyname/value pairs in some cases or simply strings depending on the 
operation.  
<P>
NOTE: cimcli does not protect the user against inputting extra options
or parameters.  Since the options are heavily dependent on the
operation to be executed, it simply ignores those options that are not
used with a particular operation.  Thus, entering the -r option (role)
with a getClass operation is syntactically allowed but cimcli ignores
the parameter.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Connection Options</H3>

<P>
There is a set of options which are general to all of the CIM
Operations and most of the compound operations and which provide
parameters for the initiation or execution of the operations (ie. identify
the target server and set connection security parameters.. 
These include:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-n [namespace]</B>

<DD>
Namespace name for this operation (ex. -n root). The default namespace
is root/cimv2 if this parameter is not entered
<DT><B>-l [location]</B>

<DD>
Host name or IP address and optionally port for this operation. The
default for this command if the -n option is not used is to use
the OpenPegasus connectLocal() function to connect to the server.  Note
that this means that a command like cimcli gc CIM_Door may not work
when trying to connect to a server other than Pegasus on the same
system. If cimcli is to be used to connect to a CIM Server other than
Pegasus on the same system use -l localhost or -l 127.0.0.1 or the
actual name or IP address.  This will force cimcli to make the
connection in the normal way, not using connectLocal()
<DT><B>-u [user-name]</B>

<DD>
The user name to be used in the connection to the CIM server for the 
command 
<DT><B>-p [password]</B>

<DD>
The password to be used in the connection to the CIM server for the 
command 
<P>
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Connect with SSL - Boolean option that specifies that cimcli should 
attempt to connect over a secure connection using SSL.  This option 
causes cimcli to modify the client connect call to set the SSLContext 
option to the certificate defined with the --cert and --key options.  If 
this option is set but neither the --cert or --key options are included, 
the SSLContext for the connect call is submitted with the Cert and key 
marked NULL.  
<P>
NOTE: Since SSL is considerd a compilable option with cimcli, these
options may not even exist in a Pegasus environment that was compiled
with the SSL capabilities disabled.
<P>
<DT><B>--cert [certificate file path]</B>

<DD>
Defines the file name of a certificate to be used with the client connect 
if the -s option is set.  This is optional and used only with the -s and 
--key options.  
<P>
<DT><B>--key [client key file path]</B>

<DD>
Defines the file name of a Client private key.  This is optional and only 
has an effect on connections made over HTTPS using -s 
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>CIMCLI OPERATION MODIFICATION OPTIONS</H3>

<P>
There is a set of options that modifies the manner in
which the command is executed or the display of information on
response including the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--t</B>

<DD>
Measure time for the operation to be completed and report it upon
command completion. If this option is set, the time for the operation
is recorded upon completion of the operation.  In addition, the client
infrastructure is queried to determine if the operation execution
times optionally measured in the infrastructure and at the server are
available. If they are, they are displayed also.  This would allow the
user to see a) time spent in the server, b) round trip time for the
operation, c) application round trip time for the operation. Note that
when combined with the repeat option, the output includes maximum,
minimum, and average times for the operation.  There are a specific
operations in cimcli to turn control statistics generation (See son
and soff operations)
<P>
<DT><B>--sort</B>

<DD>
A boolean option that requests cimcli to sort the returned entities for
multi-entity operations (ex enumerate, reference, associator). Whereas
the order of returned entities is random from most CIM Servers setting
this option outputs the objects in a defined order.  The order is based
on the Name element for classes and qualifier declarations and on the
object path returned for instances and CIM objects.
<P>
<DT><B>--r [repeat_count]</B>

<DD>
Repeat the operation repeat_count times. This repeats the operation
without disconnecting. This option is useful for setting up tests that
load the server with repeated calls and also for getting average times
for an operation by taking the average of a number of calls ( when
used with the summary information option and the measure time option). 
<DT><B>-delay [seconds]</B>

<DD>
Delay count seconds between connect and operation.
<P>
<DT><B>--sum</B>

<DD>
Present only summary information, not full output.  Generally cimcli 
presents counts of objects returned in place of the names or objects 
themselves.
<P>
<DT><B>--count [object_count]</B>

<DD>
Defines an expected count of objects to be returned in the response.
cimcli is terminated with an error exit if the number of objects returned does
not match the object_count supplied with the option. 
This test can be used in batch files to test for number of 
objects returned by an operation.  In addition to the error status code, a 
message 
of the general form:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Failed&nbsp;count&nbsp;test.&nbsp;Expected=&nbsp;xx.&nbsp;Received=&nbsp;yy&quot;
is output to cerr.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>

<BR>&nbsp;
<PRE>
   cimcli en CIM_ManagedElement -count 100

       If the count of instances returned is not equal to 100, cimcli exits
       with error code 60 and the Failed count test ... error message.
</PRE>

<DT><B>--timeout [seconds]</B>

<DD>
Set the connect timeout to some time other than the default timeout.
<P>
<DT><B>-o [ xml | mof | table]</B>

<DD>
Output type for commands that output objects. Used with commands that
present CIM objects in their response. Presents the output in the form of
xml corresponding to DMTF CIM/XML specification, mof, or for instances a
table of the data in each property.
<P>
<DT><B>-verbose</B>

<DD>
Displays details on the options and execution for the execution
of the operation.
<P>
<DT><B>--setRtnHostNames [SubstituteHostName]</B>

<DD>
String option with a required parameter that set a substitute host name 
which cimcli will insert into returned objects to replace host names 
returned from the server.  This option was defined because the object 
paths/references returned by the CIM Server may include the host name as 
part of the returned object path which makes it difficult to compare the 
returned paths to a defined path.  Using this option forces any returned 
host names to be changed to the string parameter supplied with the option. 
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>OPERATION PARAMETER OPTIONS</H3>

<P>
There is a set of options that define request parameters for 
specific cimcli Operation requests.  These are typically optional parameters 
on the CIM operation request that modify the behavior of the server to the 
request.  This includes things like requesting localonly, deep 
inheritance, etc.  Note that the actual behavior 
may be dependent on the particular operation request type.  The full 
definition of these options is below here and their use with each specific 
cimcli operation is defined with the operations.  
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-pl [propertylist]</B>

<DD>
Set the propertylist parameter for those operations that allow this parameter.
The propertylist value for this parameter is a comma-separated list of 
class properties.  This sets the propertylist optional parameter on those CIM 
operations that allow this parameter including: getClass, getInstance, 
modifyInstance, enumerateInstances, associators, and references.  If this 
option is not defined on the execution of one of these operations, cimcli 
sets the propertylist parameter to NULL indicating that all properties 
should be returned.  
<BR>&nbsp;
If a comma-separated list of one or more properties is defined as the value
for this option, a propertylist with these values is set on the CIM request
operation.
<BR>&nbsp;
Since this CIM request parameter specifically allows 3 options: 1) list of 
properties, 2) NULL which is the indicator that all properties are to be 
returned, and 3) Empty which is the indicator that no properties are to be 
include in the response, the cimcli options specifically allows defining 
the empty option by setting propertylist to either &quot;&quot; or accepts either an input that the command processor interprets as an empty 
string or as a string consisting of two quotation marks.  
<P>
The syntax of propertylist is:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;propertyName&gt;[,&lt;propertyName&gt;]*&nbsp;|&nbsp;&quot;&quot;
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cimcli&nbsp;gc&nbsp;CIM_ManagedElement&nbsp;-pl&nbsp;Caption
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cimcli&nbsp;gc&nbsp;CIM_ManagedElement&nbsp;-pl&nbsp;Caption,Description
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cimcli&nbsp;gc&nbsp;CIM_ManagedElement&nbsp;-pl&nbsp;&quot;&quot;
<P>
<DT><B>-niq</B>

<DD>
Boolean (not_include_Qualifiers) that sets the operation parameter for 
include_qualifiers to false.  Note that this form is required because the 
default for this option in the DMTF CIM Operations is true (include 
qualifiers).  Not including this option sets the request to include 
qualifiers on those commands to which this option applies.
<P>
<DT><B>-nlo</B>

<DD>
Boolean that defines whether properties from superclasses are included in 
the response.  the -nlo option turns this parameter off.  The default if 
this parameter is not included is to request that the server return only 
local properties and ignore those from superclasses.  
<P>
<DT><B>-di</B>

<DD>
Boolean to set the deep inheritance CIM operation parameter to true.
<P>
<DT><B>-ic</B>

<DD>
Boolean parameter sets the CIM operation parameter classOrigin in the
operation request to true. the CIMServer is expected to return classOrigin
information as part of the response.
<P>
<DT><B>-ac [assocatonClassName]</B>

<DD>
String defining the association Class parameter for the CIM Operation.
Used with reference and association operations.
<P>
<DT><B>-rc [resultClassName]</B>

<DD>
String defining the resultClass parameter for the CIM Operation
<P>
<DT><B>-r [role]</B>

<DD>
String defining the role parameter for the CIM Operation
<P>
<DT><B>-rr [resultrole]</B>

<DD>
String defining the resultrole parameter for the CIM Operation
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERATIONS</H2>

This section defines the individual operations supported by cimcli. 
Note that the either the names (ex. EnumerateInstances) or the shortcut (ei)
may be used in inputting an [operation] on the command line 
and they are case independent.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ci    CreateInstance</B>

<DD>
This cimcli operation requests that the server create an instance by 
building the properties of an instance from a combination of the class 
name and value parameters provided with the input.  The command issues the 
CIM operation createInstance with an instance built from the parameters 
provided.  It requires the [OperationTarget] parameter defining the class 
for which the instance is to be created and also allows for an optional 
set of value parameters that define properties to be provided in the 
created instance in the following format: 
<PRE>
  [propertyName]=value
     where value may be either a scalar for scalar properties
     or an array for array properties.

  The detailed form for the input is defined in section TBD.   
</PRE>

If the propertyName parameter is provided with no value, the default value or
NULL if there is no default value is inserted.
<P>
Note that string property values are a special case because there are actually
two concepts that must be covered when there is no value, 1) Empty String or
2. NULL/default value.
<P>
Thus when a property that requires an empty string is to be input, the user
will specify it with no value after the = sign.  If, a NULL or default value
is desired, the = sign terminator is replaced with the ! (exclamation mark).
<P>
The operation first accesses the CIMServer for the class definition and 
uses this information to build the proper value types and values for the 
instance.  
<P>
This command builds the instance with all of the properties for which
name/value pairs representing the properties of the class are input.
It does not include any properties that are not defined on the command line.
<P>
To create an instance with less than the full set of properties,
supply only those properties that are to be submitted to the CIM Server.
<P>
Scalar property values - The String form of the property similar to MOF input
of constant values is used to input scalar values.
<P>
Array property values - Array properties are defined by defining a value
of the form:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>{ scalarvalue1[,scalarvaluex]*}<BR>
<P>
Note that the array MUST NOT include any spaces between the scalarvalue
entities.
<P>
[FUTURE]The capability exists to create &quot;incorrect&quot; properties as an
additional test capability. Generally this means properties with an
incorrect type or with names that are not part of the class for which
the instance is being built.  
<P>
[FUTURE]If a property value definition is supplied with the form
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&quot;(&quot;PropertyType&quot;)&quot;[propertyName]=value
<P>
where property type is one of the CIM property types (i.e. boolean,
String, Uint8, etc.) the property will be recreated or added to the
instance with that type and name.  Thus, a property can be added with
an incorrect name or with an incorrect type overriding the definition
in the class.
<P>
The command will be rejected if the class does not exist in the namespace.
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli ci CIM_xxxx name=abc size=zyx
    cimcli ci CIM_xxxx name=abc anotherproperty=32
        create an instance of CIM_xxxx with name property value = abc, 
        a property added named another property with type uint32 and
        value of 32.
    cimcli ci CIM_xxxx name=abc arrayParam={abc,def,ghi,&quot;jkl mno&quot;        numericArray=1,2,3,4
</PRE>

Returns the object path of the created instance if the call to the CIM
server was executed successfully.  Otherwise it returns the exception received.
<P>
<DT><B>mi    ModifyInstance</B>

<DD>
This operation allows the modification of existing instances in the
target server by building the properties from a combination of the
target Class and properties provided with the input. The command
issues the CIM operation modifyInstance with an instance built from
the parameters provided.  It requires the [OperationTarget] parameter defining
the class for which the instance is to be created and a set of
value parameters that define properties to be provided in the created
instance in the format defined for CreateInstance above.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the same manner as the createInstance, this command first acquires
the class definition for the server and uses the property type
information from the class to properly crate the property value types
from the input property values.
<P>
In addition to the property definitions, this command allows the
property list options (-pl) that defines a property list to be
supplied to the target server with the modifyInstance CIM Operation.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli mi CIM_xxxx name=abc size=zyx
    cimcli mi CIM_xxxx name=abc arrayParam={abc,def,ghi,&quot;jkl mno&quot;           numericArray=1,2,3,4
</PRE>

<DT><B>ec    EnumerateClasses</B>

<DD>
Issues the enumerateClasses CIM operation which enumerates the class
hierarchy starting at the level defined by &lt;classname&gt;.
<P>
The syntax for this operation is:
<P>

<P>
where classname is not required.  If it is omitted, cimcli inserts an
empty classname into the CIM operation which tells the CIM Server to
start at the top of the class inheritance tree.  The possible options
that represent the parameters of the enumerateClasses operation are:
<P>
<P>
<B>-niq</B>

Boolean (not_include_Qualifiers) that sets the operation parameter
for include_qualifiers to false.
<P>
<B>-nlo </B>

Boolean that defines whether properties from superclasses
are included in the response. the -nlo option turns this parameter off
<P>
<B>-ic</B>

Boolean parameter sets the operation parameter includeClassOrigin in the
operation request. the CIMServer is expected to return classOrigin
<P>
information as part of the response.
<P>
<B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

Optional property list for the operation.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cimcli&nbsp;ec&nbsp;CIM_ManagedElement&nbsp;-di&nbsp;-nlo
<P>
<DT><B>nc    EnumerateClassNames</B>

<DD>
The EnumerateClassNames cimcli operation issues the enumerateClassNames
CIM Operation.
<P>
The syntax for this operation is:
<P>
<B>cimcli nc [&lt;classname&gt;] [options]</B>

<P>
The classname parameter optional and the default it is not
provided is to return the class names of the top level classes.
<P>
The options specific to this operation include;
<P>
<B>-di</B>

set the operation deepInheritance parameter = true
not localOnly
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
        cimcli nc CIM_door
            Issue getClass CIM Operation for the class CIM_Door.
</PRE>

<P>
<DT><B>ni     EnumerateInstanceNames</B>

<DD>
Execute the enumerateInstanceNames CIM Operation. The syntax for this
operation is:
<P>

<P>
Where:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classname&nbsp;-&nbsp;classname&nbsp;for&nbsp;which&nbsp;instance&nbsp;names&nbsp;are&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;enumerated.
<P>
It displays the instances names that were returned by the CIM server
in response to the enumerateInstances CIM operation with the defined
input parameters. If the --sum option is set it returns only the count of
names returned.
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli ni CIM_ManagedElement -p password -n name -n root/PG_Interop --sort

        Execute the enumerateInstanceNames operation on CIM_ManagedElement
        class in the root/PG_Interop namespace. Sort the returned list
        of instance paths.

    cimcli ni CIM_Door --sum
        Execute the enumerateInstanceNames operation on the class CIM_Door
        and return the count of instance paths returned.
</PRE>

<DT><B>ei    EnumerateInstances</B>

<DD>
Execute the CIM operation enumerateInstances. The syntax for this operation is:
<P>

<P>
This operation requests instances from the CIMServer and displays the returned
instances in a user selected format.
<P>
The following options represent specific parameters for this operation
<P>
<B>-nlo</B>

not local only operation parameter to false.  Note that this negative form 
for the option is used because the default for local only parameter is 
true.  Thus, not including this parameter means that the parameter is not 
set.  
<P>
<B>-iq</B>

Boolean (include_Qualifiers) that sets the operation parameter for 
include_qualifiers to true,  
<P>
<B>-ic</B>

Boolean to set include class origin operation parameter to true.

Set deep inheritance operation parameter to true.
<BR>&nbsp;
<B>-o [xml|mof|table]</B>

Set the output format for the instances to display the returns as mof
<P>
<B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

optional property list for the operation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It returns the instances found either as MOF,XML or a table of property
values with each property a column in the table depending on the
output options parameter.
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli ei CIM_ComputerSystem -niq -di
        This example enumerates CIM_ComputerSystem in the namespace
        root/CIMV2 (default) requesting without qualifiers (-niq) with

</PRE>

<DT><B>niall enumerateallinstanceNames</B>

<DD>
Execute an enumerateinstancenames on all classes to get all class
names within the defined namespace.  This function searches the
complete namespace using the CIM getClass operation to get the classes
and the enumerateInstanceNames command to enumerate all of the
instances for each class. It returns the list of all of the instance
names found in the namespace.
<P>
The syntax for this operation is:
<P>

<P>
where the options include any of the universal options (ex.  namespace, 
location, etc.) 
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli niall -n test/testproviders

        Returns all instancenames in the namespace test/testproviders by
        executing enumerateinstancenames on each class in the namespace.
</PRE>

<DT><B>gi    GetInstance</B>

<DD>
Gets the instance defined by the instance name parameter and displays it
in the format chosen for this operation (xml, mof, or table).
<P>
The syntax for this operation is:
<P>

<P>
which causes execution of the CIM getinstance operation.
OR
<P>

<P>
which presents a list of possible instances to the user from which one
can be selected for the getinstance.  In this case, the command
actually executes an enumerateInstanceNames to get the list of
instances that is presented to the user for selection of a single instance.
The getInstance is executed after the user makes a selection.
<P>
This command requires the [objectname] parameter.  If the parameter
is an instance with keys defined (a CIMObjectPath), the a getInstance
CIM operation is executed and the return from the CIM Server presented
(in either xml or mof depending on the output option).  If the input is
a class name, a enumerateinstanceNames CIM Operation is executed and
if any instance names are returned the result is presented to the
console for the user to select one of the instances to be deleted.
<P>
If there are no instances, the return from this command is normally an
exception as defined in the DMTF CIM Operations specification..
<P>
The possible options specific to this operation are:
<P>
<B>-iq</B>

include qualifiers. The default for getInstance is includQualifiers=false
so use of this parameter is required if the user wants qualifiers returned.
NOTE: The use of the parameter in CIM/XML has been deprecated so the provider
may not return qualifiers even if requested.
<P>
<B>-nlo</B>

localonly
<P>
<B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

optional property list for the operation
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli gi cim_ManagedElement

        This is an interactive request that returns a list of CIMObjectPaths
        from an enumerateInstance of CIM_ManagedElement from which the
        user can select one path which cimcli will uses as the [objectname]
        to execute a getInstance operation returning the instance.
</PRE>

<P>
<DT><B>di    deleteInstance</B>

<DD>
Delete instance executed a single deleteInstance command to the CIM
Server.  The syntax is:
<P>
<B>cimcli di [objectname] [options]</B>

<P>
This command requires the [objectname] parameter.  If this parameter
is a full instance name with className and key bindings, the
deleteInstance CIM Operation is executed directly.  If it is a class
name with no keybindings, the  enumerateInstances CIM Operation is executed
and the list of returned instance paths presented to the console for the
user to select one to delete.  cimcli then executes CIM deleteInstance
operation with the selected [objectname] and returns the response.
<P>
The response to this operation is either an empty response if the instance 
was successfully deleted or an exception return if there were any errors.  
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli di President.&quot;name=fred&quot; -n test/testnamespace

        Attempt to delete the instance of President with the key property
        name - fred from the test/testnamespace namespace.

    cimcli di President  -n test/testnamespace

        cimcli requests instance paths for the President class in the
        test/testnamespace and puts the complete list on the console for
        the user to select one instance to delete.
</PRE>

<P>
<DT><B>gq    getQualifier</B>

<DD>
getQualifier displays the target qualifier. The syntax is:
<P>
<B>cimcli gq [qualifier name] [options]</B>

<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
    cimcli gq abstract - returns the mof or XML for the abstract qualifier.
</PRE>

<DT><B>sq    setQualifier</B>

<DD>
This command is not implemented.
<P>
<DT><B>eq    enumeratequalifiers</B>

<DD>
Issues the CIM Operation to enumerate all of the qualifiers defined in
the target namespace. The syntax is:
<P>

<P>
There are no special options for this operation.
<P>
<DT><B>dq    deletequalifier</B>

<DD>
Issues the CIM operation to delete the target qualifier defined by
qualifier_name in the target namespace.
The Syntax is:
<P>
<B>cimcli dq [qualifier_name] [options]</B>

<P>
NOTE: This operation should be used with great caution as it removes 
qualifier declarations that may be used by other components of the model.  
<P>
<DT><B>a     associators</B>

<DD>
Execute the CIM Operation enumerate associators for the target object name.
The syntax for this operation is:
<BR>&nbsp;
<B>cimcli a [objectname] [options]</B>

<P>
Note that the objectname may be either a classname or an instancename.
If classname is supplied, the return is a set of classes that match
the objectname supplied unless the -i (interactive) parameter is used.
If objectname is used, the response is instances of the association
that matches the classname.
<P>
The options provide the various operation parameters including;
<P>
<B>-ac [assocatonClassName]</B>

association Class parameter
<P>
<B>-rc [resultClassName]</B>

<P>
<B>-pl [properytlist]</B>

Optional PropertyList
<P>
<B>-i</B>

Interactive request - If this parameter is supplied and the objectname
is a classname, the environment performs an enumerateInstances on the
objectname and presents the list of possible instances for user
selection
<DT><B>an    associatornames</B>

<DD>
Enumerate the associator names for the target object.  The syntax for this
operation is:
<P>
<B>cimcli an [objectname] [options]</B>

<P>
where objectname can be either a class name or an instance name. 
<P>
The following options provide the various operation parameters;
<P>

Interactive request - If this parameter is supplied and the objectname
is a classname, the environment performs an enumerateinstances on the
objectname and presents the list of possible instances for user
selection
<P>
<DT><B>r references</B>

<DD>
Executes the CIM Operation references. Which returns CIM Objects.
The syntax for this the operation is:
<P>

<P>
Note that the objectname may be either a class name or an instance name.  
If a class name is supplied, the return is a set of classes that of the 
association. If the -i (interactive) parameter is used with a class name
input, the user is queried for the objectname parameter.  If objectname 
is used, the response is instances of the associations that match the 
classname 
<P>
The options specifically used by this operation are:
<P>
<B>-r [role]</B>

role parameter for the CIM Operation.
<P>
<B>-rc [resultClassName]</B>

resultClass parameter for the CIM Operation
<P>
<B>-iq</B>

<B>-ic</B>

Boolean to set include class origin operation parameter to true.
<P>
<B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

optional property list for the operation
<P>
<B>-i</B>

Interactive request - This option is used only with commands that will 
accept either classname or object name as input (reference, referencenames,
associatiors, associatornames). It allows the interactive mode where the
user picks an instance from a list returned by cimcli (similar to gi where if
only the classname is supplied, cimcli knows that the user wants to pick from
a list) with these commands. If this parameter is supplied and the objectname
is a classname, the environment performs an enumerateinstances on the
objectname and presents the list of possible instances for user
selection. Thus, the user can execute interactive reference, etc. operations
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>
     cimcli a CIM_ManagedElement
          would return classs that associate with CIM_ManagedElement

     cimcli a CIM_ManagedElement -i
          executes an enumerateInstanceNames on CIM_ManagedElement and
          presents the user with a list of instances names so that the user can
          pick an instance name that will be used for the associator request.
</PRE>

<DT><B>rn    referencenames</B>

<DD>
Executes the CIM Operation referencenames that returns CIMObject paths of the
references of the objectname parameter.
<P>
The syntax for this operation is:
<P>

<P>
Note that the objectname may be either a class name or a specific instance 
name.  If classname is supplied, the return is a set of classnames that 
are references of the objectname supplied.  If the -i parameter is used 
with a class name as objectname, the user is queried to select an instance 
name for the objectname input.  If objectname is used, the response is 
instance names of the associations that matches the classname.  
<P>
The options specifically used by this operation are:
<P>
<B>-r [role]</B>

role parameter for the CIM Operation
<P>
<B>-rc [resultClassName]</B>

resultClass parameter for the CIM Operation
<P>

<DT><B>son</B>

<DD>
Set the CIMServer statistics to enabled by doing a modify instance of
the CIM_ObjectManager instance that defines the server. This depends
on the server having implemented statistics and having also
implemented the functionality of enabling and disabling statistics
through setting this property in CIM_ObjectManager.  This should be
considered a temporary operation in cimcli until a more permanent
utility is provided with OpenPegasus to manage this type of
functionality.  The corresponding operation soff will attempt to
disable statistics on the server.  This works with OpenPegasus servers
starting with version 2.5.1.

<H2>OPTIONS LIST</H2>

There are a significant number of options to this utility, some if
which provide specific information for one or more commands and some
of which are universal across all of the commands.   In general, the
program does not check for spurious options so that if you input an
option that is not used by a particular operation, it is simply
ignored. Note that some of the options require parameters.
<P>
The following is an alphabetic list of the options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ac [assocatonClassName]</B>

<DD>
The association class name parameter defines an assocClass string for
Associator calls (associators and associatornames).
Default(). 
<P>
<B>Example:</B>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-ac&nbsp;CIM_ManagedElement
<DT><B>-ar association_role_name</B>

<DD>
Defines an association role for associator operations. Example: -ar
dependent. This optional parameter is used only with the association
CIM Operations.
<P>
<DT><B>--cert  [certificateFilePath]</B>

<DD>
Defines a certificate to be used with the client connect if the -s
option is set. This is optional and used only  with the -s and --key
options. The parameter certificateFilePath is required with the parameter
and defined the file containing the certificate.
<P>
<DT><B>-delay [time in seconds]</B>

<DD>
Delay between connection and request . Default(0). example -delay 3
delays 3 seconds between the call and the transmission of the actual
CIM operation.  This is used only in some testing environments.
<DT><B>-di</B>

<DD>
Specifies the boolean parameter deepInheritance parameter for selected
commands. Setting this options causes the deepinheritance=true to be
transmitted for the operation.  Note that this means different things
to different commands and is used only with the enumerate commands.
<P>
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
More detailed debug messages from cimcli. This can be useful in the
case where the user is debugging CIM functionality.
<P>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Prints help usage message.
<P>
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>
Prints full help message with commands, options, examples.
<P>
<DT><B>-ho</B>

<DD>
Prints list of cimcli options.
<P>
<DT><B>-hc</B>

Prints cimcli Operation command list.  This list includes the CIM
Operatons defined by the CIM Operations specification and other
operations that were felt to be useful in testing CIM environments.
<P>
<DT><B>-ic</B>

<DD>
Boolean to set include class origin operation parameter to true.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-ip [inputParameterList]</B>

<DD>
Defines an invokeMethod input parameter list. Format is:
<P>
p1=v1,p2=v2,..,pn=vn (without spaces) . Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-f [filter]</B>

<DD>
Defines a filter to use for query. One String input . Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-o [ xml | mof  | table ]</B>

<DD>
Output in xml, mof, or table format. Default(mof) if the -o options
is not included.
<P>
<DT><B>-iq</B>

<DD>
Specifies the includeQualifiers operation input parameter
for selected commands.Since the CIM/XML default for this parameter is
true for some operations (class operations) and false for others
(instance operations), the option is useful only for instance operations.
Also the includeQualifiers parameter has been deprecated in the CIM/XML
specification so the results for instance operations is undetermined.
See also -niq for the includeQualifiers parameter for class operations.
<P>
<DT><B>--key [client key file path]</B>

<DD>
Defines a Client private key. This is optional and only has an effect
on connections made over HTTPS using the -ssl option.  
<P>
<DT><B>-l [location]</B>

<DD>
Define CIM Server host address for the operation.  This includes either
name or IP address and optional port number(HostName:port).  The
default is localhost:5988.  If name is used without port, port 5988 is
assumed.
Examples include -l fred, -l fred:9999, -l 10.1.134.66 -l 10.1.134.123:5977
<P>
<DT><B>-lo</B>

<DD>
Specifies the localOnly operation parameter for selected commands if
the option is set.  See the commands for more information. This option
is Deprecated in favor of the -nlo because the default for local only
is on so that generally the -lo is simply the default.  We recommend
using -nlo to turn off local only.
<P>
<DT><B>-n [namespace]</B>

<DD>
Defines the namespace for the operation.host name. The default is
root/cimv2. Example -n root/PG_Interop sets the root/PG_Interop
namespace as the namespace for the current operation. 
<P>
<DT><B>-p [password]</B>

<DD>
Allows input of a password for server authentication of the command. (
ex. -p 12345678). The default is that the command is submitted with no
password.
<P>
<DT><B>-u [User]</B>

<DD>
Defines user name for CIM Server authentication. Default is no user
name and no authentication.
( ex -u john) Default is no user name and no authentication from the
client.
<P>
<DT><B>-lo </B>

<DD>
DEPRECATED.  This was used to set LocalOnly.  However, default should be 
true and we cannot use True as default.  
See -nlo. Default(true).
<P>
<DT><B>-nlo</B>

<DD>
When set, sets LocalOnly = false on the CIM operation . Default(false).
<P>
<DT><B>-ic</B>

<DD>
Sets includeClassOrigin = true for operation that support this parameter
(i.e. get and enumerate classes and instances, associators, and references
operations).  Note that the class origin information is only output for
the -o xml output operation since class origin is not part of the MOF
format.
<DT><B>-niq</B>

<DD>
Sets includeQualifiers = false on operations. Default(false).
<P>
<DT><B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

<DD>
Defines a propertyName List which is an optional parameter for some CIM
Operations. Format is p1,p2,p3 (without spaces).  Default is that the
property list is set to NULL indicating normally that the operation
should return all properties.  The property list typically has 3
possibilities 1) empty which means return no properties, 2) list of
properties to be returned, 3) NULL which means return all properties.
Since the default is NULL, not applying the option means that all
properties are being requested.  To set this parameter to empty use
the form -pl &quot;&quot;. 
<P>
<DT><B>-r [role]</B>

<DD>
Defines a role string for reference role parameter. Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-rc [resultClassName]</B>

<DD>
Defines a resultClass string for References and Associators. Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-rr [resultRole]</B>

<DD>
Defines a role string for associators operation resultRole parameter.

<BR>&nbsp;
<DT><B>--setRtnHostNames [SubstituteHostName]</B>

<DD>
String option with a required parameter that set a substitute host name 
which cimcli will insert into returned objects to replace host names 
returned from the server.  This option was defined because the object 
paths/references returned by the CIM Server may include the host name as 
part of the returned object path which makes it difficult to compare the 
returned paths to a defined path.  Using this option forces any returned 
host names to be changed to the string parameter supplied with the option. 
<P>
<DT><B>--sum</B>

<DD>
Displays only summary counts for enumerations, associators, etc.This
option is used to with the repeat option to repeat an operation
without getting the full return display.  It reduces the display to
summary information.  It is often used with the time option --t to
generate time for execution information on many repetitions of a
command.
<P>
<DT><B>--timeout [seconds]</B>

<DD>
Set the connection timeout in seconds. If not set, the timeout is the
default Pegasus client timeout which for Pegasus is normally to about
30 seconds. This option executes the client call to set timeout.
<P>
<DT><B>-trace [trace_level]</B>

<DD>
Set Pegasus Common Components Trace.  Sets the Trace level.  0 is off.  
Default(0).  The trace level can be set to 0 - 4.
<P>
<DT><B>--v</B>

<DD>
Displays cimcli and Pegasus software Version.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose Display. Includes Detailed parameter Input display .
Default(false). Outputs extra information about the parameters
actually used in the request and the return from the operation.  This
is primarily a debugging tool.
<P>
<DT><B>--r [repeat_count]</B>

<DD>
Number of times to repeat the function. Zero means one time. The
option can be used to repeat an operation within a single call to
cimcli.  It simply repeats the operation defined the number of times
defined by the repeat_count within the same connection.  Thus, it
establishes the connection executes the operation repeat_count times
and then terminates.  It can be used with the --time option to measure
execution times for many repetitions of an operation.
<P>
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Boolean option that specifies that the Client should attempt to connect
over the secure connection using SSL. This option causes cimcli to
modify the client connect call to set the SSLContext option to the
certificate defined with the --cert and --key options.  If this option
is set but neither the --cert or --key options are included, the
SSLContext for the connect call is submitted with the Cert and key
marked NULL.
<P>
NOTE: since SSL is considered a compilable option with cimcli, these
options may not even exist in a Pegasus environment that was compiled
with the SSL capabilities disabled.
<P>
<DT><B>--sort</B>

<DD>
Sort the output objects before display for multi-object outputs such as
enumerates, references, associations, and their corrsponding ...names
operations and for the enumerateQualifierDecls.  Whereever cimcli delivers
multiple entities in the response, the use of this option tells cimcli to
attempt to sort the output entities.  Generally the sort order is assending
order using  a) class name for operations that return classes and b) CIM 
Object Path for operations that return instances.
<P>
<DT><B>--t</B>

<DD>
Measure time for the operation and present results. When set the
response time for the operation is presented with the command output.
If the --r (repeat) option is set, minimum, maximum, and average times
are presented.  Note that the time for the operation itself is
presented in addition to the overall time for connect, operation, and
disconnect.  If statistics are being gathered by the server, setting
this option also presents the server time, and the client round trip
time which are calculated by the server and client infrastructure.
<P>
<DT><B>-x</B>
